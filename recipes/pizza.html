      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>For the Pizza Dough</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>
               In a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, add warm water and yeast.
               Sprinkle sugar over top and allow to sit for 5-7 minutes or until
               the mixture begins to puff. Add the oil and the room temperature
               water. Whisk gently to combine.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               In the bowl of a stand mixer fit with the paddle attachment,
               combine salt, flour, and water mixture. When dough begins to form
               a ball, remove paddle attachment and replace with dough hook.
               With mixing speed on low, knead dough for 2-3 minutes or until a
               ball begins to form and the dough becomes smooth and elastic.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               Remove dough from bowl and place in a large well-greased bowl (I
               prefer using olive oil, but you can also use Pam). Cover bowl
               tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 2 hours. You can
               also do a "quick-rise" method and stick the bowl in an oven that
               has been heated to 200 degrees and then TURNED OFF (that way it's
               nice and warm in there, but please make sure your oven is
               actually off before sticking the dough inside). Let it rise for 1
               hour.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               To deflate dough, punch with fist. Turn onto a lightly floured
               surface and divide into two or three balls (depending on how big
               and how many pizzas you want to make… I make 2). Form into pizza
               shells to fit the size of your pan (or refrigerate the other
               dough for up to 48 hours. Place on a lightly greased pan (or one
               that has been dusted with flour or cornmeal).
            </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>For the Pizza Sauce</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>
               Combine all of the ingredients for the pizza sauce in a small
               bowl. Refrigerate until needed.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>For Baking</h3>
      <ol>
         <li><p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</p></li>
         <li>
            <p>Brush the olive oil over the entire top of the pizza dough.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               Spread an even layer of pizza sauce over the pizza, leaving about
               3/4"-1" of dough around edges for the crust.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               Top with the grated parmesan cheese, then the mozzarella. Place
               the pepperoni slices on then bake for 12-15 minutes or until the
               crust is golden brown.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the red pepper flakes, allow
               to cool for 10 minutes before topping with basil or oregano (to
               prevent discoloration and wilting). Slice and serve immediately.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ol>
